#summary Description of client application.

The client application is a simple Android App that records speech and sends it to a server on the network. You can install it by downloading it from the repository and provided you have the Android SDK and Eclipse, installing it on your phone.

As the project becomes slightly more stable I should have a version of the app on the market.
