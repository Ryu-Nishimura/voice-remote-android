		<p>Here you can configure the program to respond to any command in any way you wish. There are two tabs to the right of this one:</p>
		<ol> 
			<li>Grammars will let you define exactly what the system is to recognize. These can be individual words or sentances of arbitrary length.</li>
			<li>Actions will let you bind the recognized utterances to specific system commands.</li>
		</ol>
	
		<p> After you have configured your program to recognize the commands you want, you can either choose "Show Microphone" from the system menu, or fire up the Android client on your phone. </p>
		<p>Both programs work similarly: you press and hold the button, while you are giving the command. Upon release, the specific action is taken. </p>
